scentMatch is a unique and innovative web application that helps users discover their ideal fragrance based on their lifestyle and preferences. Our mission is to introduce people to the world of perfumes and colognes by offering personalized scent breakdowns and user analysis to give users scent recommendations that are tailored to their personality and style. Our platform caters to anyone who wants to explore the world of scents, from newbies to fragrance enthusiasts.

Our application offers a user-friendly interface where users can easily navigate and take a questionnaire to help us analyze their preferences and match them with a scent that best describes their lifestyle. Our data-driven approach, through the breakdown and analysis of scent notes, helps users to discover their ideal fragrance, and feel confident expressing their personality through their scent.

We understand that finding the perfect fragrance can be a challenge. Our solution offers a questionnaire that combines light-hearted questions and scent analysis to help users find the vibe they wish to give off when out and about in the world. Our platform offers a unique and personalized approach that helps users feel more confident in themselves and express themselves before an introduction.
